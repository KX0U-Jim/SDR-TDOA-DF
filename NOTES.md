## After unplugging the GPS `dmesg` says:

## First guess at a flowgraph in gnuradio companion

This created a large `.bin` file:
```
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mpayne mpayne 2.0G Jun 28 14:26 noaa_station1.bin
```

And it created a python file!  So cool.

```
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mpayne mpayne 8388 Jun 28 14:25 n3pay_tdoa_capture.grc
-rwxrwxr-- 1 mpayne mpayne 4433 Jun 28 14:24 n3pay_tdoa_capture.py
```
